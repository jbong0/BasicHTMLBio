      <!-- Paragraph -->
      <p> Hi, I'm Jessie! I am currently a student of University of California Berkeley - Extension. I am a San Francisco native. 
          My past professional roles have included Avation, Education, and Customer Service. Other's would describe me as witty, comedic, and "extra" (aka over-achiever). 
          I have always had the passion to be creative in many different forms. I enjoy traveling and exploring different cultures. Other than web
          development, another passion of mine is Culinary Arts. </p>
